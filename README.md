# Assignment-2

Basically there were a few changes in the prototype which made it a bit better. Background color of the prototype was bit less attractive and even because of that the text was not appropriate which is changed now and even the back buttons were not on the correct spot and the size was not same on all the pages. There were a few pictures in the protoype which were not set with the size so it looked like it was blocking the screen and it was changed too.


Changes that can be made are:
  It can have more functionalities of call the health support people in order to know more
  It can have information on relief fund and can be able to contact the team which accepts the funds and explains them how it works
  It can have the check your temperature facility.
